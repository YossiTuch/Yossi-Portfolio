## Overview
Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases my web development skills through a collection of landing pages and JavaScript projects. Each project demonstrates my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: All landing pages are mobile-friendly and adjust gracefully to various screen sizes.
- **Clean Layouts**: Each page is carefully structured to ensure a smooth user experience with balanced use of whitespace and content.
- **Modern Aesthetic**: Pages incorporate up-to-date design trends, including flat design, minimalism, and creative typography.
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Tested and optimized to work across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- **Javascript Functionality**: The javascript projects are fully functional and use-friendly

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: To structure the content of the landing pages.
- **CSS3**: For styling, including the use of Flexbox and Grid for layout, animations, and hover effects.
- **Javascript**: For adding functionality to html elements and making things more interesting.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open any of the `.html` files in your browser to view the landing pages.
   
3. All necessary assets (CSS, images, etc.) are already linked, so no extra setup is required.

## Future Improvements
